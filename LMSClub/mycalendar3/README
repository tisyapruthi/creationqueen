this is a calendar program. It has the schedule for my Monday schedule every day, and my Tuesday schedule! It has the day, time, and subject labeled. It is lined up under columns and all. This is my calendar program! (I have used Functions, loops, functions within a function, tuples, and for loops to make the THIRD version of this program.)
